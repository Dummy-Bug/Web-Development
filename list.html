            Naruto (Japanese: NARUTOナルト) is a Japanese manga series 
            written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the 
            story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition 
            from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader 
            of his village. The story is told in two parts - the first 
            set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. 
            The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: 
            Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention 
            in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and 
            Naruto (1997).
