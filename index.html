            Naruto  is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated 
            by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition 
            from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader 
            of his village. The story is told in two parts - the first 
            set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. 
            The series is based on two one-shot manga by Kishimoto: 
            Karakuri (1995), which earned Kishimoto an honorable mention 
            in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and 
            Naruto (1997).

        <p>The Uzumaki Clan (うずまき一族, Uzumaki Ichizoku) was formerly a 
            prominent clan in Uzushiogakure. Its members are renown for 
            having bright, red hair and possessing incredibly strong life-forces 
            and chakra. Since its disbandment, most of its known members reside 
            in Konohagakure. Despite the fall of Uzushiogakure and decline of 
            the clan, it never quite went extinct, and fifteen years after the 
            Fourth Shinobi World War the clan is once again active

        <p>
            The Senju Clan (千手一族, Senju Ichizoku) was one of the clans 
            responsible for founding the first shinobi 
            village: Konohagakure — the other being their rival Uchiha clan. 
            Although the clan itself no longer appears to exist as a group, 
            the Senju continue to influence Konoha's politics through their 
            philosophy of the Will of Fire and the corresponding interpretation
            of the role of the Hokage position. As such, three Senju have 
            achieved the position of Hokage.

            The Uchiha Clan (うちは一族, Uchiha Ichizoku) is one of the four noble
            clans of Konohagakure,[1] reputed to be the village's strongest 
            because of their Sharingan and natural battle prowess.[2] After 
            helping found Konoha decades ago, the Uchiha grew increasingly 
            isolated from the village's affairs, culminating in most of their 
            deaths during the Uchiha Clan Downfall. Few Uchiha now survive into 
            the present day

            that reside in Konohagakure.Its only known members are renowned 
            ninja: Konoha's White Fang (木ノ葉の白い牙, Konoha no Shiroi 
            Kiba) Sakumo, and his son Copy Ninja Kakashi (コピー忍者のカカシ, Kopī Ninja no Kakashi).
            The latter would later become the Sixth Hokage following the end of
             the Fourth Shinobi World War.
