    The Uchiha are descendants of Indra Ōtsutsuki, the elder son of Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki. 
    Through Indra, the Uchiha inherited Hagoromo's "eyes", granting them powerful spiritual
    energy and chakra. As part of the so-called "Curse of Hatred" first displayed by Indra,
    Uchiha are subject to powerful emotions: these emotions typically start as love for a 
    friend or family member that then become overpowering hatred when the object of their 
    love is lost. This loss, whether actually experienced or merely threatened, awakens an 
    Uchiha's Sharingan. It is due to the Sharingan that the Uchiha have received much of 
    their fame and notoriety.

    The Uchiha have been fighting the Senju clan for centuries, a rivalry that traces back 
    to      the days of Indra and his younger brother, Asura. When the Sage of Six Paths was 
    dying, he selected Asura as his successor, believing Asura's desire for peace through 
    love was better than Indra's peace through power. Indra, driven by his Curse of Hatred, 
    fought Asura to claim what he believed was his &nbsp &nbsp birthright. The Uchiha and Senju, 
    descendants of Indra and Asura respectively, continued their battle through the 
    centuries, though none still remembered this reason for their conflict.
